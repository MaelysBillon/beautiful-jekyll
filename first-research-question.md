### 1. Extraction of the parental advisory, explanation of the dataset

We can now analyze what is the tolerance per country about different types of violence. To do so, we have extracted the age advisory (parental certificate) from each country. Since there are missing values for countries, we decided to keep the certificates of few of them. We have in the following used dataset, film age advisories of 800 films and of 15 different countries : ['Argentina', 'Australia', 'Brazil', 'Canada', 'Finland', 'Germany','Ireland', 'Netherlands', 'Norway', 'Portugal','Singapore', 'South Korea', 'Spain', 'Sweden', 'United Kingdom'] from 1960 to 2010. To compare countries with each other we takes movies where certifiactes are available for each of these. 

Here is the distribution of films certifiactes available over decades.
