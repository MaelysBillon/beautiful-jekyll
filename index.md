# Representations of violence and public appraisal


## Abstract 
After the Aurora shooting in Colorado in July 2012 (twelve people killed and 58 others injured), during the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises, controversy arose around the release of the film Joker. Considered too violent, very strict security measures were taken before its theatrical release, where it is rated R. Violence has always been a pillar in media. From tragic Greek theater to public executions, its powerful emotional impact stirs attention. In films, violence can manifest in increased sensory details. The representation of violence can be, depending on the audience's appreciation, the era, the culture, more or less explicit, more or less tolerated with different stereotypes in play. Our project aims to analyze the co-dependency between public appraisal, tolerance, and representations of violence, under different dimensions such as financial success, the tone of the films (comedy or drama), and geo-political context (nation, era).

This data story studies the presence of violence in the [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/). We use a bag-of-words approach to detect different types of violence in a movie summary. In particular, we lowercase the movie summary corpus and match only the base form of a word to include word variations. The following word cloud shows the 130 words in our violence dictionary colored by type of violence. A word's frequency in the movie summary corpus determines its size in the word cloud.
