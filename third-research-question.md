# Gender disparities

It can be interesting to see how genders relate to violence representations. 

Do men or women appear more often in violent content ? If yes, of which type ? 

To see, for each actor/ actress we can find the proportion of violent movies in which he plays out of the entire
filmography. Having done for each actor, we can then use histograms to visualize the distribution of the number of actors in function 
of the proportion of films, in the actor's filmography, that contain a certain type of violence in the summary. And we do a separate histogram
for each type of violence. The distributions of male and females are superposed to see the differences.

We can see that the distributions of males and females differ mostly in scale. Indeed, there is significant higher number of male
actors. Otherwise, the distributions have similar shape between genders. On closer inspection, except for torture and sexual violence,
male distributions are skewed slightly to the right, meaning that there is a majority of males with high proportion of violence in their filmography. Also, notice that, on the top left histogram, there is a small bump of female actors with 50% violence in their filmography. 
Opposedly, on the bottom right histogram, there is a small bump of male actors who have a proportion close to 0 of "other violences",
which in our categorization, refers to lighter violence as opposed to murder, wide-scale violence, sexual violence and torture.
