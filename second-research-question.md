# How is violence represented in different countries and languages?

* * *

The representation of violence can be as varied as one's imagination allows because it is such a broad topic.
Its level of public acceptance of explicitness is a difficult threshold to draw for universal acclaim.
Different cultures tolerate this kind of representation to varying degrees.
Naturally, when we refer to culture, we mean people from different parts of the world as well as from diverse historical periods.
Each person's background towards violence is unique, and this background may have historical roots.
Conflicts, instability, and morality can influence people's desire to see explicit violence.

## Violence throughout the decades

As in the rest of our project we separate 4 different types of violence namely **"murder"**, **"torture"**, **"widescale violence"** and **"sexual violence"**.

We decide to plot the ratio of movies containing words related to the previously stated types of violence in function of release year.

Theses distribution show us two main things:
- **Murder and wide-scale violence have always been the most represented type of violences compare to torture and sexual violence.**
The last two barely reach the 10% of representation in their best decades, but wide-scale violence and murder are almost touching the 50%. One explanation (that has been showed in the previous part) is that presence of terms related to murder and wide-scale violent does not nececerally mean that this violence is explicit and is show graphically. Torture and sexual violence in the other hand are not as promoted in the summary. 
This can be linked to those type of violence to be less appealing, more taboo around the world. 

- **Each type of violence is experiencing a increasing representation through the decades, following a big peak, this peak happens in a different decades**
The most striking example is sexual violence, its representation more than doubles between the 50's and the 70's. Between these decades the United States experienced a sexual liberation, that comes with a speech freedom around sexual violence. The soft power of the US during theses years was huge and this revolution surely impact other countries around the world. However, we must temper this analysis: this type of violence remains marginal and is clearly not one of the most striking of the 1970s.
Wide-scale violence see its peak in the 40s. We can try to explain it by the world war that happens during this time period. A fun thing to notice is that during the few decades after the world war II the top genre of movies with wide-scale violence in their summary was "Drama" by far. However in the 70s the "Action" genre was the second most using these terms, in the 40s it was not even is the top10. This show a shift in the representation of violence. 


Even if the number of movies using different terms of violence in their summary is the same or is evolving does not mean that its representation is the same throughout the era. Everyone has already heard some parents say that "in my youth the movies were telling a story now it's just blood and guns".

## Violence through the world

The world cannot always be treated as a whole. In order to add more subtlety to our story we will have to separate the different countries in order to understand why films representing different forms of violence are so common in our time. Each country has its own culture, trivializing more or less certain types of violence. Some are taboo or completely banned in many parts of the world, others are used on a large scale. This can be explained by the customs of the country, its religion, its politics (dictatorship, monarchy...) or its geo-political situation.

To realize this analysis we thought that interactive graphs would allow us to have a better vision of these differences. Indeed, our dataset contains more than 20,000 American films, which can prevent us from seeing a trend for the other countries. In the following graphs, a simple click on the countries in the legend allows to discard them.
